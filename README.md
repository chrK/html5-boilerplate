# HTML5 Boilerplate (chrK Fork)

This fork of [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate/) neither adds more sophisticated functionality nor is it really a fork. It is a leightweight version adjusted to my own habitudes providing a boilerplate I use as a starting point for my daily coding.

**Removed** 

* build/
* demo/
* test/
* Google Analytics snippet

**Added**

* less/ (As I usually use [less](http://lesscss.org) the already existant stylesheets were seperated and moved to less/
* [Better Web Readability Project - CSS Library](http://code.google.com/p/better-web-readability-project/)
* 1140 [CSSGrid](http://cssgrid.net/)


## Todo

* Further code cleanup and integration of less
* Seperation of fixes in less/fixes.less (too much redundancy atm)
* (Nicer) integration of fluid & responsive grid
